  * Check for ModemManager same or newer than 1.18
    
    We are shipping focal's MM client library in the network-manager
    snap. The library will fail if talking to an older verions of MM
    daemon than the one for the library, which is an issue as focal has
    updated MM from 1.16 to 1.18, so NM would fail to use modems if there
    are old versions of the MM snap in the system. To prevent this
    problem, check for the MM version in post-refresh and install hooks
    and fail if the MM daemon is not modern enough.

          which is normal behavior for glib-based software
        - missing `Build-Depends-Package` in `libmm-glib0` symbols file

        - system-wide `fcc-unlock.d` folder installed even though we don't ship
          any distro-specific configuration which would be included there
      * d/modemmanager.prerm: don't call systemctl directly.
        Debian provides a helper tool for avoiding direct calls to systemctl in

  [ Lukas Märdian <lukas.maerdian@canonical.com> ]
  * Update netplan integration for v0.104 compatibility
    
    netplan_clear_netdefs() is being called to early, therefore netdef_id is
    undefined/garbage and can not be used to calculate a path.
    
    This did work in netplan <= 0.103 as there was a memory leak and netdef_id
    was not actually cleared, starting with 0.104 the memory leak is fixed and
    we need to adopt the NetworkManager integration accordingly.
    
    This change is compatible with old and new versions of libnetplan.
    Merge-Proposal: https://code.launchpad.net/~slyon/snappy-hwe-snaps/+git/network-manager/+merge/415663
  * Update netplan integration patch
    
    If existing connections are being modified via 'nmcli' netplan does not know
    about the existing netdef_id, as the path to the keyfile is not in the format
    'run/NetworkManager/system-connections/netplan-*.nmconnection'
    
    If there is an previous existing netplan connection, make sure to pass the new
    keyfile, but at the location/path of the old connection profile, so that
    netplan is able to derive the original netdef_id.
    
    Also, make the full:immutable-netplan-config a bit more robust, by avoiding the volatile connection profile generated by NM. And avoid deleting non-netplan (e.g. volatile) connections via libnetplan.

    - https://bugs.launchpad.net/snappy/+bug/1926442
    
    Refresh 0002-nm-netplan-keyfile.patch
    
    netplan 0.103 compat changes are now integrated with the original patch, as
    that version landed in UC20, changes to NM's unit-tests are not needed anymore.
    
    Also, avoid calling into the netplan_generate() libnetplan API, this would just
    execute the 'netplan generate' CLI, which would then call the
    io.netplan.Netplan.Generate() DBus API in snap environments.
    We can avoid this additional redirection and be independent from deprecation
    or changes that are incompatible with the snap environment in the
    netplan_generate() API, by calling the 'netplan generate' CLI directly.
    Ideally, in the future we would avoid this redirection as well and call into
    the io.netplan.Netplan.Generate() DBus method directly. But we need to pass a
    --root-dir argument during the execution of NM's unit-tests, that is currently
    not supported by the DBus method, so let's stick with the CLI for now.
    
    This depends on the snapd snap to be >= 2.53.2+git864.g5823952 (currently in snapd/edge).

    This reverts commit bd2e479614ec595050aaf4f0f63f6aec12adc095.
    The change was needed so tests could run after changing the
    epoch. However, this caused races as connections happen after the snap
    is installed, and NM starts without all the permissions it
    needs. Revert this back as now we have an epoch 1 snap already
    published in 20/beta and we can install it without errors.

    [PATCH] platform: use also statvfs() to check for udevd
    
    Check whether or not there is a running udevd by using statvfs() on
    "/sys" and use access() as a fallback. This is in line with what is
    done by systemd [1] and helps in case NM is not really running in a
    container but has been confined by a MAC so it does not have full
    access to sysfs (access() returns EACCES). Fixes LP:#1712918,
    LP:#1893184.

  * Flush IPs of devices we are taking control of in the wrapper, after
    calling netplan apply and before starting NetworkManager. netplan
    leaves IPs configured by networkd around and that confuses
    NetworkManager. This is a workaround until LP:#1870561 is fixed. As
    we are using the 'ip' command for this, we need to add network-observe

      * SECURITY UPDATE: rhostname buffer overflow
        - debian/patches/CVE-2020-8597.patch: fix bounds check in EAP code in

  [ Alfonso Sanchez-Beato <alfonso.sanchez-beato@canonical.com> ]
  * Remove patches from the debian folder
    We take them from snap-patch now.
    
    Add phony part to stage compiled packages
    
    Remove version-script
    version-script is now deprecated.
    
    Add patches specific to the NM snap to snap-patch
    
    Follow applied branches from auto-import repos
    
    tests: run iptables from core snap now
    
    Set rc-manager=symlink for UC18 and later
    Otherwise, NM will call resolvconf even though it fails if UC version is
    newer than 16. To properly set DNS we need to set both dns and
    rc-manager options, but we were doing this only for the former. However,
    this did not have adverse effects as, as said, the call to resolvconf
    failed, while systemd-resolved was properly updated.
    
    Do not call dhcp-lease-mover anymore
    As it was not actually working anymore since we were not staging inotify
    anymore since a while.
    
    Specify explicitly copyrights to include
    Previously there were copyright files included from non-staged
    packages.
    
    Add unstage.txt file
    This file contains a list of debian package that we are not actually
    staging, although snapcraft adds them to manifest.yaml. CI now
    recognizes this file, and manually removes the listed packages from the
    manifest when releasing a snap to the store.
    
    Do not stage iptables/xtables
    iptables and all needed libraries are now included in the core18 snap,
    since revision 1049 (2019-06-27).
    
    Do not stage libs already in core18
    The libraries were not really included finally in the snap, but they
    were triggering CVE warnings from the review tools that did not actually
    apply.
    
    snap: call netplan apply using DBus
    Use DBus netplan interface to re-start network services after setting
    NetworkManager as the default renderer.
    
    snap: add network-setup-control interface
    Add network-setup-control interface so we can call 'netplan apply' from
    the snap.
    Merge-Proposal: https://code.launchpad.net/~alfonsosanchezbeato/snappy-hwe-snaps/+git/network-manager/+merge/378377
  * Change changelog file name to the standard one
    Merge-Proposal: https://code.launchpad.net/~alfonsosanchezbeato/snappy-hwe-snaps/+git/network-manager/+merge/378390
  * Unstage some packages from networkmananger-phony
    The networkmananger-phony part was staging as dependencies packages that
    we were not actually including in the snap. Add to the list of packages
    to unstage on release.

  * Add missing bits to enable sharing connections and be able to access points. Fixes LP: #1832494.
    Merge-Proposal: https://code.launchpad.net/~alfonsosanchezbeato/network-manager/+git/network-manager/+merge/369325
  * snap: remove debug info
    
    Remove debug info, which was inadvertingly introduced in a previous
    commit. This reduces the snap size in two thirds.
    Merge-Proposal: https://code.launchpad.net/~alfonsosanchezbeato/network-manager/+git/network-manager/+merge/370807
  * snap: remove kernel-module-control interface
    
    The firewall-control interface already provides a kmod plug that makes
    sure the modules needed by ip tables are pre-loaded on boot.

  * This is manual merge of the NM 1.2 snap changes re-based on top
    of NM 1.10. It's also the first release of the snap from this git
    repository (vs. the network-manager snappy-hwe-team git repo).
    This branch was created from the bionic distro branch, and uses
    the distro patches, a snap support patch, and direct commits for
    snap packaging changes.
