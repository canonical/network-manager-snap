# Install NetworkManager

The NetworkManager snap is currently available from the Snap Store. It can
be installed on any system that supports snaps but is only recommended on
[Ubuntu Core](https://www.ubuntu.com/core) at the moment.

You can install the snap with the following command:

```
 $ snap install network-manager
 network-manager (1.10/stable) 1.10.6-7 from Canonical✓ installed

```

All necessary plugs and slots will be automatically connected within the
installation process. You can verify this with:

```
$ snap connections network-manager
Interface              Plug                                   Slot                     Notes
dbus                   network-manager:wpa                    -                        -
firewall-control       network-manager:firewall-control       :firewall-control        -
hardware-observe       network-manager:hardware-observe       :hardware-observe        -
login-session-observe  network-manager:login-session-observe  :login-session-observe   -
modem-manager          network-manager:modem-manager          modem-manager:service    -
network                network-manager:network                :network                 -
network-manager        network-manager:nmcli                  network-manager:service  -
network-observe        network-manager:network-observe        :network-observe         -
network-setup-control  network-manager:network-setup-control  :network-setup-control   -
network-setup-observe  network-manager:network-setup-observe  :network-setup-observe   -
ppp                    network-manager:ppp                    :ppp                     -

```

**NOTE:** The _network-manager:modem-manager_ plug only gets connected
when the _modem-manager_ snap is installed too. Otherwise it stays
disconnected. Similarly, there is a _network-manager:wpa_ plug in case
we would want to use a custom wpa supplicant snap instead of the one
supplied by the core snap (this is not generally recommended).

Once the installation has successfully finished the NetworkManager
service is running in the background. You can check its current status
with

```
 $ systemctl status snap.network-manager.networkmanager.service 
 ● snap.network-manager.networkmanager.service - Service for snap application network-manager.networkmanager
    Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/snap.network-manager.networkmanager.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
    Active: active (running) since Thu 2020-07-09 10:19:01 UTC; 6min ago
  Main PID: 2850 (NetworkManager)
     Tasks: 3 (limit: 569)
    CGroup: /system.slice/snap.network-manager.networkmanager.service
            └─2850 /snap/network-manager/564/usr/sbin/NetworkManager --config-dir=/var/snap/network-manager/564/conf.d/ --config=/snap/network-manager/564/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf --log-level=INFO --no-daemon
```

Now you have NetworkManager successfully installed.

## network-manager tracks and channels

The network-manager snap has currently three tracks:

 * **24**: Contains upstream 1.46.0 and has a core24 base. The track
   name refers to the base snap.
 * **22**: Contains upstream 1.36.6 and has a core22 base. The track
   name refers to the base snap.
 * **20**: Contains upstream 1.22.10 and has a core20 base. The track
   name refers to the base snap. Nowadays, this is the one installed
   by default if the channel is not specified when running `snap
   install`.
 * **1.10**: Contains upstream 1.10.6 and has a core18 base. The
   track name refers to the upstream version. More modern releases
   have changed the convention so the track now refers to the base
   snap.
 * **latest**: Contains upstream 1.2.2 and has a core16 base. Despite the unfortunate
   name (there are historical reasons for that) it is the oldest version.

All these tracks are available with the usual risks: stable,
candidate, beta, and edge, but only the stable version should be used
for production devices. The meaning of the other risk levels is
internal to the development team of the network-manager snap.
